# CellClassification

# Solar Panel Defect Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to address the computer vision problem of detecting and classifying defects in solar panels using Electroluminescence (EL) imaging. Our team has developed methods to predict the health of photovoltaic (PV) cells within solar modules. This work was carried out as a part of a group project for [Your Course Name], and it adheres to the academic integrity guidelines provided by UNSW.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Electroluminescence Photovoltaic (ELPV) dataset, which consists of 2,624 EL images of functional and defective PV cells. Details regarding the dataset and its usage can be found within the dataset directory in this repository.

## Methods
We have developed two distinct methods for the classification task:

1. **Method 1 Description:** (e.g., A traditional machine learning approach using feature extraction and SVM classifier.)
2. **Method 2 Description:** (e.g., A deep learning approach using a modified CNN architecture.)

For more information, refer to the `methods` directory.

## Installation and Usage
To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[Your GitHub Username]/solar-panel-defect-detection.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab:

   ```

## Training and Testing
We followed the recommended split of 75% for training and 25% for testing using stratified sampling. For detailed procedures on training and testing, see the `training` and `testing` directories, respectively.

## Results
Our methods' performances are documented through confusion matrices, overall accuracy, and F1 scores. For a detailed report on the results, please refer to the `results` directory.

## Deliverables
- **Video Presentation:** A detailed presentation of our approach, results, and discussion can be found [here](video_link).
- **Written Report:** The comprehensive report documenting our methodology, results, and analyses is available in the `docs` directory.

## Discussion and Future Work
We have provided insights into the performance discrepancies between different solar module types and suggested directions for future research. These discussions can be found in the `discussion` directory.
